1. The length (modulus) of the vector.
3. Equality of vectors.
4. Angle between vectors.
5. Addition of vectors.
6. Subtract vectors.
7. Multiplication vectors.
8. Incrementing and decrementing.
9. Indexing.
10. The multiplication of the vector by the number.
11. Scalar product of vectors.
12. Vector product of vectors.
13. Mixed product of vectors.
14. Orthogonality of vectors.
15. Collinearity of vectors.
16. Coplanarity of vectors.
17. Linearly dependent and linearly independent vectors.
18. Decomposition of a vector in basis.
